I am a Ph.D. student at [Unisveristy of Alaska Fairbanks](www.uaf.edu) but I am based in Juneau, AK at a sattelite campus of the UAF [College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/). The overarching question of the dissertaion research is: What is the role of sea otters in southeast Alaska? Chapter 1 focuses on the how subsistense hunting of sea otters by Alaska Natives may ot may not effect the sea otter population. Chapter 2 and 3 delve into the direct and indiect effects of sea otter in eelgrass ecosystems. Much of my research in encompased in a much larger project called [APECS](www.apecs-ak.org) led by my advisor [Dr. Ginny Eckert](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/index.xml?id=101). 

Other than my Ph.D. research I am broadly interested in nearshore community ecology and trophic ecology using obervational, experiemntal, biomarker, and modeling techniques. I aspire to use build on ecological theory to answer compelling questions at the interface of ecology, conservation and management. I strive to combine multiple techniques and data sources including observational, experimental, biomarkers, data mining etc. to address such research questions. Before I started my Ph.D. studied invasive [lionfish](http://hixon.science.oregonstate.edu/sites/hixon.science.oregonstate.edu/files/publications/Raymond%20et%20al%2014%20EBF%20invasive%20lionfish%20vs%20Nassau%20grouper.pdf) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) and [marine spatial subsidies](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v509/p213-225/) and [shoreline armoring](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771416301007?via%3Dihub) at [Friday Harbor Labs](https://fhl.uw.edu/).
