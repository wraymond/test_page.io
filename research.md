# Ph.D.

My Ph.D. reasearch tackles questions realated to sea otter reconlonization in southeast Alaska. 

## Chapter 1 - Spatial and temporal patterns and population effects of sea otter harvest in southeast Alaska
While sea otters are protected from commerical harvest under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), coastal Alaska Natives are exempt from this ban. Sea otters harvested by Alaskan natives are reported to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These data are what my co-authors and I are using to describe the spatial and temporal patterns of harvest. We are also using these data to develope a population simulation model which will allow us to test the effect that known harvest mortality may or may not have on the sea otter population as a whole. 

For this project I am collaborating with the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/alaska/) and with [Tim Tinker](https://werc.ucsc.edu/Tinker/Tinker_dk.html). The project is funded my [Alaska SeaGrant](https://alaskaseagrant.org/)

## Chapter 2 - Eelgrass community relationships across a gradient of sea otter recovery

## Chapter 3 - Disentangling thr trophic relationships of southeast Alaska eelrass communities

## Trends and carrying capacity of sea otters in southeast Alaska
This project aims to improve the population estimate of sea otters in southeast Alaska using Bayesian analysis techniques and by incorporating sea otter harvest data. This project is lead by [Tim Tinker](https://werc.ucsc.edu/Tinker/Tinker_dk.html) and I have used by experience with the sea otter harvest data from my Ph.D. to integrate those data into this new population model. This project is nearly complete and a paper is currently under peer review.

## Using Condition Estimates of a Marine Foundation Species to Infer Temporally Integrated Seawater Nutrient Fields
In collaboration with [Tom Bell](http://www.tomwbell.net/about.html) we are trying to use reflectance measurements of mature giant kelp blades in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum to estimate tissue nitrogen content. This [technique](http://www.tomwbell.net/uploads/5/6/9/7/56976837/bell_etal_2015_rse.pdf) was developed in California and our goal is to see if we can improve it by including data from other regions. This project is ongoing and was made possible by [Goetz Instrument Program](https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/about-us/our-brands/asd-inc/student-support-programs/goetz-instrument-program).
