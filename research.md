# Ph.D.

My Ph.D. reasearch tackles questions realated to sea otter reconlonization in southeast Alaska. 

## Chapter 1 - Spatial and temporal patterns and population effects of sea otter harvest in southeast Alaska
While sea otters are protected from commerical harvest under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), coastal Alaska Natives are exempt from this ban. Sea otters harvested by Alaskan natives are reported to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These data are what my co-authors and I are using to describe the spatial and temporal patterns of harvest. We are also using these data to develope a population simulation model which will allow us to test the effect that known harvest mortality may or may not have on the sea otter population as a whole. 

For this project I am collaborating with the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/alaska/) and with [Tim Tinker](https://werc.ucsc.edu/Tinker/Tinker_dk.html). The project is funded my [Alaska SeaGrant](https://alaskaseagrant.org/)

## Chapter 2 - Eelgrass community relationships across a gradient of sea otter recovery
As a part of the [APECS](www.http://apecs-ak.org/) projcet, I am investigating the role of sea otters in eelgrass beds in southeast Alaska. Specifically we are interested if trophic cascade patterns observed in [Elkhorn Slough](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/08/23/1302805110.short) California and similar patterns in the [Baltic Sea](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16521.x) scale up to Southeast Alaska. In 2017 the APECS team collected data from multiple eelgrass sites on [Prince of Wales Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Island_(Alaska)) on eelgrass, epiphytes, grazers, crabs, fishes, and sea otters. I am currently in the analsis and writing stages of this project and hope to submit a manuscript soon!

This project is funded primarily by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) but has also recieved support from a number of small grants I have obtained including a [North Pacific Research Board](https://www.nprb.org/) Graduate Student Research Award, the [Steven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship](https://mfs.fisheries.org/?page_id=155) from the American Fisheries Society, and the [Lerner-Gray Fund for Marine Research](https://www.amnh.org/our-research/richard-gilder-graduate-school/academics-and-research/fellowship-and-grant-opportunities/research-grants-and-student-exchange-fellowships/the-lerner-gray-fund-for-marine-research) 

## Chapter 3 - Disentangling the trophic relationships of southeast Alaska eelrass communities
Building off Chapter 2 we wanted to delve deeper into the trophic relationships amoung eelgrass associated species. For this project we are using stable isotopes and fatty acids from key members of the eelgrass community to trace energy flow and tease apart dietary relationships. Field work for this project was conducted in 2018 and tissue samples will be processed during the 2018/2019 school year.

This work is funded by the same sources as Chapter 2 and also benefits from a close partnership with my committee member [Aaron Galloway](https://www.aaron-galloway.com/) and his lab at [Oregon Institute of Marine Biology](https://oimb.uoregon.edu/)

# Other projects

## Trends and carrying capacity of sea otters in southeast Alaska
This project aims to improve the population estimate of sea otters in southeast Alaska using Bayesian analysis techniques and by incorporating sea otter harvest data. This project is lead by [Tim Tinker](https://werc.ucsc.edu/Tinker/Tinker_dk.html) and I have used by experience with the sea otter harvest data from my Ph.D. to integrate those data into this new population model. This project is nearly complete and a paper is currently under peer review.

## Using condition estimates of kelp to infer temporally integrated seawater nutrients
In collaboration with [Tom Bell](http://www.tomwbell.net/about.html) we are trying to use reflectance measurements of mature giant kelp blades in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum to estimate tissue nitrogen content. This [technique](http://www.tomwbell.net/uploads/5/6/9/7/56976837/bell_etal_2015_rse.pdf) was developed in California and our goal is to see if we can improve it by including data from other regions. This project is ongoing and was made possible by [Goetz Instrument Program](https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/about-us/our-brands/asd-inc/student-support-programs/goetz-instrument-program).

## Sea otter - Zostera network
This project led by [Brent Hughes](https://web.sonoma.edu/biology/faculty/brent_hughes.html) aims to combine data on sea otter and eelgrass from acorss the west coast of the U.S. to look at large scale patterns of sea otter - eelgrass community interactions.
